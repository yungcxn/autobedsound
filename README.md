# autobedsound

In Minecraft there's a server called "GommeHD.net".

The Gamemode "Bedwars-Clanwars" plays a sound when you defeat your opponent.

So you can use this tool to create your custom bedsoundpack from only one YouTube video and the part of the sound you want to use.

So you don't need to create any folders, download and cut your sound.

## Build / Install

1. Use with "python"

  It's a python file, so you would only need to install the modules needed via pip.
  You can see them in the beginning of the file.

2. Build with "PyInstaller"

  Create an executable for usage without complex installation of pip modules aso.

3. Download in the "Releases" section

  There should be a x64 Version for Windows
